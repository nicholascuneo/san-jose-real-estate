# San Jose Real Estate

This repo contains project files for a capstone project aimed at building a regression model that can be used to predict property values. This is an analysis of the San Jose housing market from April 2019 through April 2021.

There has been a tremendous growth in the selling price of properties since 2019. The data collected off [Redfin](https://www.redfin.com/city/17420/CA/San-Jose) are of sold homes in the city over the previous 2 years, and will be used to determine a property's true market value.

For this project we are a team working for a new Real Estate firm focused on investing in single family properties. To build capital while developing a long term strategy,  they are looking to purchase homes that are undervalued in their current price, and sell them at their true value to provide quick short term ROI. We are tasked with analyzing the market trends and ultimately creating a model that will be used to identify undervalued properties that are viable investments. What locations and layouts are found most profitable.

We will make use of python libraries such as numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn to clean, visualize and perform exploratory and inferential data analysis on the market. Then we will create visuals in PowerBi to deliver our findings to the firm.
